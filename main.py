# The idea is to have m games and n snakes in every game to run at the same time.
# Once all snakes are dead (across all the games), they are improved with a Generic algorithm
# map. Update method returns all the dead snakes from a game once that game finishes (None otherwise)
# The dead snakes need to be evaluated. Maybe use their size or lifetime as a metric. Use the best to
# get new weights for the neural network. DO NOT CREATE NEW SNAKES during/after the Genetic algorithm.
# New snakes should only be created at the beginning (this reduces the amount of garbage). Just swap out
# their brains.
